# Example test 
def add(a, b):
    # Return the result of adding a and b.
    return a + b

# For the rest of these tests, write the content inside the methods yourself
# Add the necessary return statement and remove the pass keyword

# Test 1
def subtract(a, b):
    pass
    # Return the result of subtracting b from a.

# Test 2
def multiply(a, b):
  # Return the result of multiplying b with a.
  pass

# Test 3
def divide(a, b):
  pass
# Return the result of dividing b by a.

# Test 4
def remainder(a, b):
  pass
# Return the remainder of dividing a by b using the modulo operator.

# For the rest of these tests, write the methods yourself according to the instructions given

# Test 5
# Write a method called "float_division" which takes the arguments a and b
# Return the result of dividing a by b as a float.
# constraints: a and b are integers

# Test 6
# Write a method called "string_to_number" which takes a single string as an argument.
# Return the result of converting the string to an integer
# constraints: the argument is a string

# Test 7
# Write a method called "is_even" which takes a single number as an argument.
# Return the result of checking whether the given number is an even number
# constraints: the argument is an integer
#              the output must be of boolean type 

# Test 8
# Write a method called "is_odd" which takes a single number as an argument.
# Return the result of checking whether the given number is an odd number
# constraints: the argument is an integer
#              the output must be of boolean type
